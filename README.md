# **Notaryze**
Notaryze is an open-source tool designed and developed by `Quilio Ltd` to simplify the notarization process for developers. It provides a convenient interface to code sign and product sign software, ensuring compatibility and security for macOS users.
## **Motivation**
As developers ourselves, we understand the frustrations and challenges that come with code and product signing. The security measures put in place by platforms like Ventura are crucial, but they can also create significant barriers for entry, especially for newer developers. We've experienced firsthand how the process can be both time-consuming and finicky, leading to unnecessary roadblocks in the development workflow.
Our motivation for creating Notaryze is to break down these barriers and streamline the signing process. We believe that developers should be able to focus on what they do best—creating amazing software—rather than getting tangled in the complexities of code signing. By offering a simple and intuitive tool, we aim to make the process more accessible to developers of all experience levels.

# How to use
After opening the software, sign in using valid credentials (Developer ID or Team ID and associated Password) to start using the tool. Based on whether you want to Code Sign or Product Sign, you can click and drag the file(s) to be signed into the interface. Alternatively, you could click on "Upload" to upload files using the Finder.
Once files have been uploaded to the tool, you will see a list that provides information about the uploaded files. This includes the name, file type, and status. As long as there is one file ready to be signed, the "Start" button will be enabled. During signing, you can stop the process before all of them time out if required.
You can view your profile information or sign out by clicking on the profile icon on the top right.
## Data and Privacy
“Name” will be stored in keychain on your system locally as a key under Notaryze
“Email ID”, “Developer / Team ID”, and “Password” are stored as secured keys under the dictionary reference.
When the user signs-out explicitly, the data is removed from the keychain.
When “Keep me signed in” is checked, the information gets stored in the keychain before you sign-in.
